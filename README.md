## Math with Processing

Some basic math from high school done in processing and trigonometry 

# Math

A guide for mathematical formulas in Processing.

(0.0) Unite Circle = uniteCircle.pde 

(0.1) Raidial Circle = unite.pde -> A radial signal shape 2D

(0.2) Sine Wave = sineW.pde -> Sine Wave in 2D

(0.4) Spiral = d.pde  -> spiral in 3D

(0.5) Sine 3D = wavez.pde -> A sine wave plane in 3D

(1) Sphere = simpleSphere.pde -> A sphere of points

(1.5) Cube = cube.pde -> Particles inside a cube 

(2) Torus 


# Physics

  (0.1) Sine Wave Physics = sinePh.pde  -> Movement of a sine wave.
  
  (0.2) Particle System = p5.pde -> particle system.


# The Gradient

Is the partial differential of a vector

delV = < Fx, Fy, Fz >
